## next version

### Fixed
- Fix Xcode 9.2 warning https://github.com/xcodeswift/xcproj/pull/209 by @keith

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `XCWorkspace.Data` renamed to `XCWorkspaceData` and removed `references`.

## 2.0.0

### Added
- Deterministic reference generation https://github.com/xcodeswift/xcproj/pull/185 by @pepibumur

### Removed
- **Breaking Change** `Referenceable` protocol https://github.com/xcodeswift/xcproj/pull/185 by @pepibumur.
- **Breaking Change** Deprecated methods to access objects from the `PBXProj`. Developers should use the `PBXProj.objects` property instead. https://github.com/xcodeswift/xcproj/pull/185 by @pepibumur.

### Fixed
- **Breaking:** `PBXSourceTree` no longer has raw values and gained an associated value case to support custom locations https://github.com/xcodeswift/xcproj/pull/198 by @briantkelley

### Changed
- **Breaking:** The `buildableProductRunnable` property on`XCScheme.LaunchAction` and `XCScheme.ProfileAction` is now optional. Similarly, `macroExpansion` on `XCScheme.TestAction` is also optional. https://github.com/xcodeswift/xcproj/pull/194 by @briantkelley
- The `XCScheme` initialization from an XML file has been relaxed, better matching Xcode's behavior. Default values will be used if the XML file is missing the relevant element or attribute. https://github.com/xcodeswift/xcproj/pull/194 by @briantkelley

### Migrate from 1.x.x to 2.x.x
- If you were using objects getters in `PBXProj` you should use the getters in `PBXProj.objects` instead.
- Objects don't include a `reference` property anymore. Objects associated references are the keys in the dictionary that contains them.
- When objects are added to the `PBXProj.objects` collection a reference needs to be passed. The reference can be calculated using the function `PBXProj.objects.generateReference` that generates a unique and deterministic reference based on the given object and identifier.
- If you were using `buildableProductRunnable` and `macroExpansion` properties from `XCScheme` actions they are now optionals.
